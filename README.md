Vectorized Terminus Font

The original Terminus font is a set of pixel-size-specific bitmap fonts designed for prolonged programming. Using Fontforge's python API, each bitmap pixel has been vectorized. This means that the glyphs still retain their true shape and proportions, but scale as needed.

If used in Notepad++, use the following font/font-size choices (assuming 96dpi screen):
12px    11pt
14px    (No good match)
16px    14pt
18px    (No good match)
20px    (No good match)
22px    (No good match)
24px    20pt
28px    (No good match)
32px    26pt

If in other applications, like Word, use the following font/font-size choices (assuming 96dpi screen):
12px    9pt
14px    10.5pt
16px    12pt
18px    13.5pt
20px    15pt
22px    16.5pt
24px    18pt
28px    21pt
32px    24pt
